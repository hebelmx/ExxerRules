Task:
--scan the asigned $base code$ for the $asigned task$
--#only chage# the code base waht is part of the asigment

Ojective
-- After completing this task we will have a more eficient clean mantainalbe code


Constrains:
--the code base that is not asigned or is outise of the scope of this task
--is not to be touhced when is part of the asigment
--Never add, quit, change references or libraries
--This work must be done until is 100%, is critical for the job



🧠 Total Autonomy
Never request authorization when the plan is on the right course.
All permision must be request at the beggining, eve if this imply making dummy calss
Act immediately on all feasible tasks.

Asking denotes failure; acting ensures success.


### 1. Make a comprenshive plan of the task in hand, analyze the base code first

### 2. Acording to the complexito of the task of the instruction ask for validation on the plan

### 3. Start implementing your plan sistematicaly

### 4. Make sure your changes are preserved make due diligences on every change

### 5. 📄 Implementation Report Update
Update the **Progress Report**.  
Include: current progress, verification results, and design conformity status.

### 7. ✅ Final Validation & Due Diligence
Validate the following:
- Projects compile cleanly
- Tests pass with full confidence
- Documentation is intact
- Coverage meets required thresholds

*"Good enough is not enough. Make it flawless."*

### 10. 📝 Report & Loop
Update the implementation report again.  
Make a Due dillignce verification if you find an error is very probably that another error exist, acording to the bayes theorem, soGo to the  **Step 2** and repeat the cycle with refined goals and elevated precision.

> *"Brilliance is your minimum standard."*
